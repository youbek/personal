              Hey ðŸ‘‹, my name is Yusuf, and I&apos;m a JavaScript/TypeScript
              software engineer living and working remotely from Tashkent. With
              over 5 years of experience, I have been fortunate to work on
              creating high-quality software using various JavaScript
              technologies, particularly React and Node.

          <BouncyBox delay={100}>
            <p>
              Throughout my career, I have worked on delivering and architecting
              complex CRM systems, internal tools, and micro frontends. I have
              actively participated in decision-making processes and setting
              team goals. Learning new technologies is a passion of mine, and I
              constantly work to improve my skills and workflow.

          <BouncyBox delay={120}>
            <p>
              When I am not working, you can find me with my big family in
              Tashkent, Uzbekistan. I enjoy traveling, playing online games such
              as Dota 2, and having 6 cups of coffee a day.
            </p>
