              Over the course of my 5+ years of experience Iâ€™ve been fortunate

              I worked on delivering and architecting complex CRM systems,
              internal tools, micro frontends. I actively participated on
              decision making, as well as teamâ€™s goal setting. I enjoy learning
              new technologies and constantly work on improving my skills and
              workflow.

              When not working, you can find me in Tashkent, Uzbekistan with my
              big family. I enjoy traveling, playing online games such as Dota
              2, and I enjoy having 6 cups of coffee a day)
