              Hey üëã, I&apos;m Yusuf, a JavaScript/TypeScript software engineer

              I&apos;ve worked on a variety of projects, including delivering
              and architecting complex CRM systems, leading frontend work on
              core features, internal tools, and micro frontends. I actively
